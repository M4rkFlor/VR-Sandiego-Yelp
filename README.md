#VR Sandiego
Created a VR Smart City application in Unity and used Yelp Fusion Api ,Blender and Google VR SDK in a 24h Hackathon with a team of 5.

**What this apllication does:** Target a building and information from the yelp fusion api will be provided about that building.

This was a good learning experience for my team and me because we lost the hackathon to someone who didn't even program. 
Now I know for future hackathons to focus more on creating a powerpoint presentation with visual appealing images.

we called post requests in unity to a server to send authenticated requests and map building ids to places on yelp using yelp fusion api.
The server is no longer in operation so the program no longer works as intended.
I commented out the api calls and hard coded values the server would give back, so that others could see how it was working, however do note that targeting different buildings gave different information in the live version.
If you are super curious the canvasmanager and yelp script has the source code for the server calls.
